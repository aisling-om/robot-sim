# robot-sim
A project to control a simulated mobile inverted pendulum using an extended Kalman filter on simulated noisy data.

This documents the final capstone project of the Coursera Robotics Specialization developed by the University of Pennsylvania. The specialization includes 5 courses in robot dynamics, motion planning, mechanical mobility, perception, and estimation and learning. 

This project includes the following files:

MIP_simulation.pdf : the documentation of the project. 6 pages, 8 figures. RevTex4-1. 
anim_step.avi : 16.7 MB video of the simulated MIP following a step trajectory based on noisy measurements
anim_sin.avi:   16.7 MB video of the simulated MIP following a sine trajectory based on noisy measurements
